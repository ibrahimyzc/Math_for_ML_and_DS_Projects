# Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the **Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization** on Coursera. The specialization provided a deep dive into the essential mathematics required for machine learning and data science, covering topics such as linear algebra, calculus, and probability & statistics.

## Courses in the Specialization

### 1. **Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science**

This course focused on the fundamental concepts of linear algebra that are critical in the field of machine learning. We explored topics such as matrix operations, solving systems of linear equations, and understanding the geometric interpretations of vectors and matrices.

#### Key Topics and Projects:
- Introduction to NumPy arrays for linear algebra operations.
- Solving systems of linear equations.
- Vector operations, matrix multiplication, and linear transformations.
- Final assignment combining multiple linear algebra concepts.

### 2. **Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science**

This course introduced key concepts of calculus, focusing on optimization techniques, which are crucial for training machine learning models. We learned about differentiation, gradient descent, and optimization methods such as Newton's method.

#### Key Topics and Projects:
- Optimization using gradient descent.
- Regression using the perceptron algorithm.
- Newton's method for optimization.
- Final project applying calculus techniques to machine learning problems.

### 3. **Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning and Data Science**

The third course covered fundamental concepts in probability and statistics, which are integral to many machine learning algorithms. We studied probability distributions, the central limit theorem, and hypothesis testing.

#### Key Topics and Projects:
- Simulations of the Monty Hall problem and the birthday problem.
- Probability distributions through dice simulations.
- Demonstrating the central limit theorem with simulations.
- Final project using probability and statistics in real-world scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language used for coding all projects.
- **NumPy**: For matrix and vector operations in the linear algebra sections.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results in the probability and statistics sections.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for developing all assignments and labs interactively.
